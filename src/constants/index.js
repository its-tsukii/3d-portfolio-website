export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hey, I’m Aayush Kukade – your friendly DevOps enthusiast and Cloud explorer. When I’m not wrangling Docker containers or trying to decode Kubernetes, you’ll find me solving algorithms like they’re puzzles (promise, no boring tech talk here!). I’m currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications and a Diploma in Programming from IITM as part of the IITM BS Degree Program – because who doesn’t love juggling two degrees?
I’m on a mission to build efficient, scalable systems and deploy them faster than you can say "CI/CD." When I’m not coding, I’m usually writing about it on my blog or sharing memes with fellow DevOps geeks!`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a Cloud/DevOps enthusiast with hands-on experience in Cloud technologies, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. I specialize in building scalable, automated systems that run smoothly in production. With a strong problem-solving mindset and a passion for backend development, I’m always looking for ways to optimize processes and streamline deployments. I bring technical expertise, a drive for continuous learning, and a commitment to delivering reliable, efficient solutions.`;
